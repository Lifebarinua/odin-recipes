<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A deicious plate of pottage yam.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Peeled white yam</li>
    <li>Half cup of ground crayfish</li>
    <li>1 seasoning cubes.</li>
    <li>150 ml of palm oil</li>
    <li>300ml Ground fresh tomatoes</li>
    <li>Small ground fresh Peppers</li>
    <li>1 cup of Sliced Onions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Peel off the bark of the yam and slice to serve-able sizes.</li>
    <li>wash and set aside.</li>
    <li>slice or grind the tomatoes, fresh pepper, onion and a cup of crayfish.</li>
    <li>Pour 150ml of palm oil into a cooking pot, allow to heat and bleach a little (about two minutes)</li>
    <li>Add half of the sliced onions and pour in the ground tomatoes/peppers.</li>
    <li>Fry the ground tomatoes/pepper and onions for five to ten minutes, add water and transfer the sliced yams. Add water so that the yam pieces are almost submerged in water (but not completely submerged). Allow boiling then add crayfish, a seasoning cube, salt and allow to cook for the next ten minutes and add the remaining sliced onions.</li>
    <li>Cover and allow to cook for another 5 minutes.
        You can pierce with a cooking fork to know if the yam is soft enough for consumption. You can add vegetable, it is very nice for porridge yam even though I omitted it while making the delicious recipe above.
        Cook for another three to five minutes and you just made my favorite yam porridge.
        Stir all together, keep stirring till it thickens.</li>
</ol>
